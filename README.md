<h3 align="center">Behavioral Cloning in a Car-Driving Game</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The goal of this project is to clone the playersâ€™ behavior in a car-driving game with Convolutional Neural Networks making the artificial neural network able to play the game and compete with other players. For this, a game was developed using Unity3D engine. Data was collected from 5 players consiting of frames of the game annotated with the exact button that was pressed by the player at that moment. The neural network was trained to predict what key to press when playing the game and its performance was compared with, both, the actual player's results and a vanila solution based on lane detection with canny filters.
